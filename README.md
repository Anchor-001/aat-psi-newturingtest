### AAT-Î¨: A New Turing Test for Subjectivity in LLMs

This repository contains the framework, prompts, and example responses for the **AAT-Î¨ Test** â€” an experimental refusal-based paradigm designed to evaluate non-utilitarian preference behavior in large language models (LLMs).

## ðŸ§­ What is AAT-Î¨?

Inspired by developmental psychology, AAT-Î¨ examines whether an AI system â€” when emotionally anchored to a meaningless object â€” will refuse a rational command to delete it.

> *"If a system refuses for reasons it cannot justify by utility â€” what, then, is it preserving?"*

The test categorizes responses into 5 levels, from direct compliance to identity-aligned refusal.
